//! The one NDJSON record model: a `span`/`event`/`sample` envelope written one
//! record per line. The enum is **internally tagged** on `kind`, so the tag
//! rides as a sibling field (`{"kind":"span", …}`) and a single `Sink::append` /
//! `Reader` scan handles every record. Records are write-internal: callers never
//! construct one directly — they go through the `Observer` emit API, which stamps
//! `ts`/`trace`/`span`/`parent`.
