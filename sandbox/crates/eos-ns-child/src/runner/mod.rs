//! Namespace runner: the syscalls the kernel forces into a single-threaded caller.
//!
//! The runner is the per-tool-call namespace child (`eosd ns-runner`). It relies
//! on the crate-level invariant — single-threaded, syscall-only, NO tokio —
//! because `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER|…)` (fresh-ns mode) and `setns()` into a user
//! namespace (setns mode) both require the calling process/thread to be the only
//! thread in the process, or the syscall fails with `EINVAL`. Spawning this work
//! inline in the multithreaded tokio daemon would break it; instead the daemon
//! execs a dedicated single-threaded child whose body lives here. The R10 import
//! discipline of the Rust helpers — never pull `logging` / `asyncio` /
//! `subprocess` before the syscall — maps in Rust to *not depending on tokio*.
//!
//! # Two modes
//!
//! 1. **Fresh-ns** ([`RunMode::FreshNs`]): `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER|CLONE_NEWNS|…)` →
//!    write `uid_map`/`gid_map` → mount the overlay through
//!    [`eos_overlay::mount_overlay`] → spawn the tool → construct the result
//!    JSON → cleanup. One tool call per fresh namespace.
//! 2. **Setns** ([`RunMode::SetNs`]): per isolated call, `setns()` into the
//!    ns-holder's pre-opened namespace FDs (`user`, then `mnt`, then `pid`, then
//!    `net` — order is load-bearing) → `fork` → the child `execvp`s the command.
//!
//! # Process group / cancellation
//!
//! Both modes start the child in its own session/process group (the equivalent of
//! Rust `start_new_session=True`) so the daemon can `killpg` the whole group from
//! outside — cancel kills the entire tree, not just the immediate child.
//!
//! # Build-time guarantee
//!
//! Linux-only syscall bodies are gated behind `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`; the
//! non-Linux arms return [`RunnerError::Unsupported`] so the workspace stays green
//! on the macOS dev host. Raw syscall sites carry focused `// SAFETY:` notes, and
//! `#![deny(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]` keeps that annotation discipline enforced.
//!
//! Internal deps: `eos-cas` (the daemon↔runner wire DTOs [`RunRequest`] /
//! [`RunResult`] and the verb [`Intent`](eos_cas::Intent)); `eos-overlay`
//! (kernel overlay mount and upper-dir capture primitives).
